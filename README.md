## React Flashcard Application Documentation

This React application is an interactive flashcard study tool designed primarily for precalculus concepts, though its structure allows easy adaptation to other subjects. It offers features such as flippable flashcards, category-based filtering, search functionality, and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing flashcards. Data persistence is implemented using local storage, ensuring that user progress and modifications are preserved across sessions.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Flashcards**: Flippable cards display terms, definitions, and examples.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter flashcards by subject or topic.
- **Search Functionality**: Search terms or definitions to quickly find cards.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete flashcards with ease.
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage retains user data between sessions.

### Components

The application is built with a modular structure, utilizing the following key components:

- **`App.tsx`**  
  The central component that orchestrates the application. It manages state, handles filtering and search logic, and renders child components. It serves as the entry point for all major functionality.

- **`Flashcard.tsx`**  
  Represents an individual flashcard with a flip animation to toggle between the term and its definition/example. Includes edit and delete buttons, with a confirmation prompt for deletions to prevent accidental removal.

- **`FlashcardList.tsx`**  
  Displays a responsive grid of flashcards, sorted by category and term. Uses Bootstrap's grid system for layout adaptability across screen sizes.

- **`FlashcardForm.tsx`**  
  A reusable form for adding or editing flashcards. Switches between "Add" and "Edit" modes dynamically and includes validation for required fields (e.g., term, definition).

- **`Sidebar.tsx`**  
  A navigation menu for filtering flashcards by category. Highlights the active category and includes an "All" option to view unfiltered results.

- **`data.ts`**  
  Defines the `Flashcard` interface and provides initial sample data. Extracts unique categories into a separate array for filtering and form dropdowns.

### Data Management

Flashcard data is stored as an array of objects with the following structure:

```typescript
interface Flashcard {
  id: string;         // Unique identifier
  category: string;   // Topic or subject area
  term: string;       // Concept or term
  definition: string; // Explanation of the term
  example?: string;   // Optional illustrative example
}
```

- **Categories**: Unique categories are derived from the flashcard data and stored separately to support filtering and dropdown menus.

---

### State Management

State is managed primarily in `App.tsx` using React hooks:

- **`useState`**:
  - `flashcards`: The array of flashcard objects, initialized from local storage or default data.
  - `selectedCategory`: Tracks the active category filter.
  - `searchTerm`: Stores the current search input.
  - `showForm`: Toggles the visibility of the form modal.
  - `editingCard`: Holds the card being edited (if any).

- **`useEffect`**:
  - Synchronizes the `flashcards` state with local storage whenever it changes, ensuring data persistence.

---

### User Interactions

The application supports the following user interactions:

- **Flipping Cards**: Clicking a card flips it to show the definition and example.
- **Filtering by Category**: Selecting a category from the sidebar updates the displayed flashcards.
- **Searching**: Typing a search term filters cards based on matches in the term or definition.
- **Adding Flashcards**: A form modal allows users to create new flashcards with required field validation.
- **Editing Flashcards**: Existing cards can be edited via the form, pre-populated with current data.
- **Deleting Flashcards**: Deletion requires confirmation to avoid accidental data loss.

---

### Styling and UI

- **Bootstrap**: Provides consistent styling and a responsive grid layout for components like the flashcard list and sidebar.
- **Custom CSS** (`Flashcard.css`):
  - Implements a 3D flip animation for flashcards.
  - Adjusts card sizes and text responsively for different screen sizes.
  - Adds hover effects and category-specific styling for visual clarity.

---

### Local Storage

Data persistence is achieved using the browser's `localStorage`:
- The `flashcards` array is serialized to JSON and saved whenever it updates (e.g., after adding, editing, or deleting a card).
- On application load, the state is initialized by deserializing the stored data, falling back to default data from `data.ts` if no stored data exists.
